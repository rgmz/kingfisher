# Writing Custom Rules for Kingfisher

A _rule_ in Kingfisher is a YAML document that describes how to detect and (optionally) validate secrets in your codebase. With custom rules you can:

- **Extend** Kingfisher without touching Rust code  
- **Tune** sensitivity via entropy and confidence  
- **Plug in** live checks against external services  

This document explains how to write custom rules for Kingfisher using a YAML-based rule system. The rules define regular expressions to detect secrets in source code and other textual data, and they can include validation steps to confirm the secret's authenticity. By using a rules-based system, Kingfisher is highly extensible—new rules can be added or existing ones modified without changing the core code.

## 1. Rule Schema

Each rule file defines one or more entries under a top‑level `rules:` list. Every entry supports the following fields:

```yaml
rules:
  - name:           # (string) Human-friendly rule name
    id:             # (string) Unique identifier (e.g. kingfisher.aws.1)

    pattern: |      # (multi-line regex) Detection pattern
      (?x)(?i)
      aws
      (?:.|[\n\r]){0,32}?
      \b([A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40})\b

    min_entropy: 3.5                # (float) Minimum Shannon entropy
    confidence:  medium             # (enum: low | medium | high)

    examples:                       # (list) strings that must match
      - AWS_SECRET="AKIA…"

    references:                     # (optional list) context URLs
      - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html

    visible: true                   # (bool) hide helper matches when false

    depends_on_rule:                # (optional) capture chaining
      - rule_id: kingfisher.aws.id
        variable: AKID              # referenced as {{ AKID }}

    pattern_requirements:         # (optional) character/word requirements
      min_digits: 1                 # require at least 1 digit
      min_uppercase: 1              # require at least 1 uppercase letter
      min_lowercase: 1              # require at least 1 lowercase letter
      min_special_chars: 1          # require at least 1 special character
      special_chars: "!@#$%^&*()"   # optional: custom special character set
      ignore_if_contains:                # optional: drop matches containing these words
        - test

    validation:                     # (optional) live validation
      type: Http
      content:
        request:
          method: GET
          url: https://api.example.com/v1/check
          headers:
            X-Secret: "{{ TOKEN }}"
            X-Id:     "{{ AKID }}"
          response_is_html: true # by default, validation responses containing HTML or considered invalid. Set to `true` if you expect HTML returned from a validation response
          response_matcher:
            - report_response: true   # always include raw payload
            - type: StatusMatch
              status: [200]           # positive check
            - type: StatusMatch
              status: [401,403]
              negative: true          # negative check → must NOT match
            - type: HeaderMatch
              header: content-type
              expected: ["application/json"]
            - type: JsonValid
```

## 2. Templating with Liquid
Kingfisher leverages the Liquid template engine for dynamic parts of HTTP request bodies, headers, query parameters, and multipart payloads. The engine supports both built-in and custom filters to manipulate the captured secret (TOKEN) or other named captures ({{ NAME }}).

### Using Liquid Filters in Validation
- **Capture Injection**: The unnamed capture from your regex becomes {{ TOKEN }}. Named captures are made available as uppercase variables (e.g. {{ RDMVAL }}).
- **Filter Pipeline**: You can chain filters using the pipe (|) syntax:

```liquid
{{ TOKEN | b64enc | url_encode }}
```
Arguments: Some filters accept parameters, provided after a colon:

```liquid
{{ TOKEN | hmac_sha256: "my-secret-key" }}
```

### 3. Built-in & Custom Liquid Filters

**Chaining & Composition:** Filters can be stacked; e.g.:

```liquid
Authorization: Basic {{ "api:" | append: TOKEN | b64enc }}
```

**Runtime Values:** Filters like unix_timestamp and uuid are evaluated at runtime, enabling nonces, timestamps, and unique IDs in your requests.
### How depends_on_rule Works

- **Dependency Declaration:**  
  In your YAML rule definition, you add a `depends_on_rule` section. Here you specify:
  - **rule_id:** The identifier of the rule whose output is required.
  - **variable:** The name (typically in uppercase) that will be used to reference the captured value from the dependency rule.

- **Chaining Captures:**  
  When Kingfisher scans a file, it processes rules in a specific order. If a rule has a dependency, the engine first checks whether the dependent rule has already matched on the same input (or blob). If it did, the captured value (for example, an access key ID) is made available to the dependent rule.

- **Using the Captured Value:**  
  This captured value can then be used during the validation phase. For instance, if you have a rule for an Algolia Admin API Key that depends on an Algolia Application ID (captured as `APPID`), the validation logic can incorporate the `APPID` value to confirm that the secret matches the expected pattern or format for that specific account.

### Use depends_on_rule to require one rule before another runs:

```yaml
depends_on_rule:
  - rule_id: kingfisher.algolia.app_id   # must match first
    variable: APPID                     # captured as {{ APPID }}
```

- **Capture flow**: First rule captures `APPID` → second rule injects `{{ APPID }}` into validation HTTP request or pattern
- **Visible control:** set `visible: false` on the supporting rule so it doesn’t clutter your report for non-secret matches
## Algolia Example

Consider this example rule for an Algolia Application ID and Admin Key combination. To validate that this is an active credential, both must be matched:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Algolia Admin API Key
    id: kingfisher.algolia.1
    pattern: |
      (?xi)
      algolia
      (?:.|[\n\r]){0,32}?
      \b
      (
        [a-z0-9]{32}
      )
      \b
    min_entropy: 3.5
    confidence: medium
    examples:
      - algolia_api_key = "ij1mut5oe606wlrf5z4u8u31264z3gag"
    validation:
      type: Http
      content:

            X-Algolia-API-Key: '{{ TOKEN }}'
            X-Algolia-Application-Id: '{{ APPID }}'
          method: GET
          response_matcher:
            - report_response: true
            - status:
                - 200
              type: StatusMatch
          url: https://{{ APPID }}-dsn.algolia.net/1/keys
    depends_on_rule:
      - rule_id: "kingfisher.algolia.2"

### How It Works:

* Algolia Application ID Rule (kingfisher.algolia.2):

  This rule scans for an Algolia Application ID—a 10-character alphanumeric string. It is marked with visible: false so that even if it matches, the finding is not directly reported. Its primary role is to provide a supporting value for other rules rather than to be flagged as a secret by itself.

* Algolia Admin API Key Rule (kingfisher.algolia.1):
  This rule detects the Algolia Admin API Key using a regex pattern. It includes a depends_on_rule property that specifies a dependency on the Algolia Application ID rule.

  * The dependency declares that the rule requires the output of the Algolia Application ID rule, and the captured value is assigned to the variable APPID.
  * In the validation section, this captured `APPID` is used dynamically in the HTTP request (for example, in the header `X-Algolia-Application-Id` and in the URL).

The dependency mechanism (depends_on_rule) ensures that:

* Non-secret data (like an application ID) is captured without cluttering the scan report (thanks to visible: false).
* The secret (the API key) is validated in context, with the necessary supporting information automatically injected.
* Rules remain modular and extensible; you can update the dependent rule or its pattern independently, and the change will automatically be reflected where the value is used.

## The `visible: false` Property

The `visible: false` property tells Kingfisher to hide the finding from the final scan report. This is particularly useful for rules that capture data not meant to be reported as a secret, but rather to serve as supporting context for another rule.

For example, a rule might match a username, an email address, an AWS Access Key ID, or an Application ID. While these pieces of information are captured during scanning, they are not secrets on their own. Instead, they are used by other rules—via the `depends_on_rule` mechanism—to validate an associated secret. By marking such rules as `visible: false`, you prevent these non-secret findings from cluttering your report, yet their values remain available for dependent rules.

`visible: false` helps keep the scan output focused on actual secrets while still capturing important contextual data needed for comprehensive validation.

## Character Requirements

The `pattern_requirements` field allows you to specify data type requirements for matched secrets. This is particularly useful when:

- Your regex pattern must be permissive (due to Hyperscan limitations)
- You want to enforce password complexity requirements
- You need to filter out low-quality matches that lack certain character types

Kingfisher's regex engine (Hyperscan) does not support lookahead assertions like `(?=.*\d)` to require specific character types. Instead, use the `pattern_requirements` field to filter matches post-detection.

### Available Requirements

```yaml
pattern_requirements:
  min_digits: 1              # Require at least 1 digit (0-9)
  min_uppercase: 1           # Require at least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
  min_lowercase: 1           # Require at least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
  min_special_chars: 1       # Require at least 1 special character
  special_chars: "!@#$%^&*"  # Optional: define which characters are "special"
  ignore_if_contains:             # Optional: reject matches containing any of these (case-insensitive)
    - test
    - demo
  checksum:                      # Optional: compare rendered values to drop mismatched formats
    actual:
      template: "{{ MATCH | suffix: 6 }}"   # Liquid template for the observed checksum
      requires_capture: checksum            # (optional) skip unless this capture is present
    expected: "{{ BODY | crc32 | base62: 6 }}"  # Liquid template to render the expected checksum
    skip_if_missing: true                   # (optional) treat missing captures as legacy tokens
```

All fields are optional. If `special_chars` is not specified, the default set includes: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:'",.<>?/\`~`

`ignore_if_contains` performs a case-insensitive substring check. If any entry (after trimming whitespace) appears within the match, the match is discarded. This is helpful for dropping known dummy tokens such as "test" or "demo" that otherwise satisfy the regex.

The optional `checksum` block renders Liquid templates against the match to determine whether the captured checksum matches your expectation. Both templates gain access to `{{ MATCH }}`, `{{ FULL_MATCH }}`, and every named capture in two forms: the original capture name and its uppercase alias (e.g. `{{ body }}` and `{{ BODY }}`). Use helper filters like `suffix`, `crc32`, and `base62` to mirror provider-specific checksum pipelines. If a required capture is missing or the rendered values differ, Kingfisher skips the finding—logging the reason, including checksum lengths, at the `DEBUG` level. Set `skip_if_missing` to `true` to treat absent captures as legacy matches.

When any of these filters remove a match it is logged at the `DEBUG` level so you can see exactly why the skip occurred. If you need to keep every match even when one of these substrings appears, pass `--no-ignore-if-contains` to `kingfisher scan`. The flag disables this post-processing step without changing the rule definitions.

### Are `requires_capture` and `skip_if_missing` equivalent?

`requires_capture`
 - Optional field that names a specific regex capture that must be present before the checksum templates are evaluated.
 - In the engine, Kingfisher checks whether that capture exists in the match context. If it’s missing, the behavior falls back to whatever `skip_if_missing` dictates (fail or treat as a legacy match).

`skip_if_missing`
 - Boolean switch that controls what happens when Kingfisher can’t render the checksum—because there’s no match context or a required capture is absent.
  - `true`: silently skip (pass) the match so legacy, non-checksum tokens are still accepted.
  -  `false`: treat the situation as a validation failure.

In short, `requires_capture` identifies which capture must exist, while `skip_if_missing` determines whether missing data is a hard failure or an allowed legacy case.

### Example: Secure API Key

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Secure API Key
    id: custom.secure_api.1
    pattern: |
      (?xi)
      api[_-]?key
      (?:.|[\n\r]){0,32}?
      \b
      ([A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*]{20,})
      \b
    min_entropy: 4.0
    confidence: high
    pattern_requirements:
      min_digits: 1           # Must contain at least 1 digit
      min_uppercase: 1        # Must contain at least 1 uppercase letter
      min_lowercase: 1        # Must contain at least 1 lowercase letter
      min_special_chars: 1    # Must contain at least 1 special character
      ignore_if_contains:
        - test
    examples:
      - api_key = "MyS3cur3K3y!2024"
      - 'api-key: "Abc123!@#Token"'
```

In this example:
- The regex pattern is permissive: `[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*]{20,}` matches any combination of those characters
- The `pattern_requirements` filters out matches that don't have at least one of each required type
- A match like `"abcdefghijklmnopqrst"` would be rejected (no uppercase, no digit, no special)
- A match like `"Abc123!SecureToken"` would be accepted (has all required types)
- A match like `"Test123!SecureToken"` would be rejected because it contains the `ignore_if_contains` term `test`

### Example: Excluding Dummy Values

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Token without placeholders
    id: custom.token.2
    pattern: |-
      (?i)token[:=]\s*([A-Za-z0-9]{12,})
    pattern_requirements:
      ignore_if_contains:
        - placeholder
        - sample
    examples:
      - token: "REALVALUE1234"
    negative_examples:
      - token = "SAMPLETOKEN9999"  # dropped by ignore_if_contains
```

### Example: Custom Special Characters

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Token with Custom Special Chars
    id: custom.token.1
    pattern: |
      (?xi)
      token
      (?:.|[\n\r]){0,16}?
      \b([A-Za-z0-9$%^]{16,})\b
    min_entropy: 3.5
    confidence: medium
    pattern_requirements:
      min_special_chars: 2
      special_chars: "$%^"    # Only these characters count as "special"
    examples:
      - token = "abc$%defgh123456"
```

### How It Works

1. Hyperscan regex matches a pattern in the input
2. Entropy check filters low-complexity matches (if `min_entropy` is set)
3. **Character requirements check filters matches that don't meet the criteria**
4. Validation checks verify the secret is live (if `validation` is configured)

Matches that fail the character requirements check are silently dropped with a debug log message.


## Writing Custom Rules

When writing custom rules, consider the following best practices:

1. **Multi-line Regex:** Write your regex patterns over multiple lines for clarity. Use the `(?x)` flag to enable free-spacing mode.
2. **Optimize for Performance:** Structure your regex to minimize backtracking. Use non-capturing groups where possible and keep the pattern as concise as possible.
3. **Validation Integration:** Define a `validation` section if you want to verify the detected secret. You can use Liquid templating to insert dynamic values—use the unnamed capture as `TOKEN` and any named captures in uppercase.
4. **Test with Examples:** Always include examples that should match and, optionally, negative examples to ensure your rule behaves as expected.
