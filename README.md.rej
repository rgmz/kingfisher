 ## 📝 Write Custom Rules!
 
 Kingfisher ships with hundreds of rules with HTTP and service‑specific validation checks (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to confirm if a detected string is a live credential.
 
 However, you may want to add your own custom rules, or modify a detection to better suit your needs / environment.
 
 First, review [docs/RULES.md](/docs/RULES.md) to learn how to create custom Kingfisher rules.
 
 ### Pattern requirements and placeholder filtering
 
 Every rule can declare optional `pattern_requirements` to enforce additional character checks after a regex matches. Each field
 is independent:
 
 - `min_digits`, `min_uppercase`, `min_lowercase`, and `min_special_chars` enforce complexity thresholds.
 - `special_chars` lets you override the set of characters counted as "special" when `min_special_chars` is used.
 - `ignore_if_contains` lists case-insensitive substrings that should cause a match to be discarded (for example, to drop
   `test`, `demo`, or `localhost` values). Kingfisher still accepts the legacy `exclude_words` key as an alias when loading
   existing rule files.
-
-When a match is skipped because of `ignore_if_contains`, Kingfisher logs the event at the `DEBUG` level alongside the rule that
-was evaluated. If you need to keep those matches for a particular scan, pass `--no-ignore-if-contains` to `kingfisher scan` to
-disable the substring filter without editing any rule files.
+- `checksum` lets you compare an extracted portion of the match against a Liquid-rendered expectation. Provide `actual.template`
+  and `expected` Liquid snippets (with access to `{{ MATCH }}`, `{{ FULL_MATCH }}`, and any named capture as both its original
+  case and uppercase alias) and Kingfisher will skip the finding when the rendered values differ. Optional keys such as
+  `requires_capture` and `skip_if_missing` help you guard against legacy formats while onboarding the checksum-aware variant.
+
+When a match is skipped because of `ignore_if_contains` or a checksum mismatch, Kingfisher logs the event at the `DEBUG` level
+alongside the rule that was evaluated. If you need to keep those matches for a particular scan, pass `--no-ignore-if-contains`
+to `kingfisher scan` to disable the substring filter without editing any rule files. Verbose mode (`-v`) will also show you the
+checksum mismatch lengths so you can confirm why a finding was suppressed.
+
+To support checksum workflows, Kingfisher now includes Liquid helpers such as `suffix` (to slice characters from a match),
+`crc32` (to hash the body), and `base62` (to encode and pad the checksum). You can mix these filters with your own templates to
+mirror provider-specific checksum implementations.
 
 Once you've done that, you can provide your custom rules (defined in a YAML file) and provide it to Kingfisher at runtime --- no recompiling required!
 
 # 🎉 Usage
 
 ## Basic Examples
 
 > **Note**  `kingfisher scan` detects whether the input is a Git repository or a plain directory, no extra flags required.
 
 ### Scan with secret validation
 
 ```bash
 kingfisher scan /path/to/code
 ## NOTE: This path can refer to:
 # 1. a local git repo
 # 2. a directory with many git repos
 # 3. or just a folder with files and subdirectories
 
 ## To explicitly prevent scanning git commit history add:
 #   `--git-history=none`
 ```
 
 ### Scan a directory containing multiple Git repositories
 
 ```bash
