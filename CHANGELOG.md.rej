 # Changelog
 
 All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
 
 ## [Unreleased]
 - Added `pattern_requirements` for rules. Enables post-regex character-class checks (digits, uppercase, lowercase, specials) to reduce false positives without lookarounds. Provides lightweight, in-memory validation after matches, keeping patterns fast and readable.
 - Added an optional `ignore_if_contains` list to `PatternRequirements` within the Rules structure, so matches containing case-insensitive placeholder words are filtered out, with accompanying tests to cover the new behavior.
 - Updated many rules with `pattern_requirements`
+- Added checksum comparisons to `pattern_requirements`, new `suffix`, `crc32`, and `base62` Liquid filters, and verbose logging so mismatched checksums are skipped with context rather than reported as findings.
+- Split GitHub token detections into fine-grained/fixed-format variants and enforce checksum validation for modern GitHub token families (PAT, OAuth, App, refresh) while preserving legacy coverage.
 - Automatically set `--no-dedup` whenever `--manage-baseline` is supplied so baseline management retains every occurrence of a finding
 
 ## [v1.61.0]
 - Fixed local filesystem scans to keep `open_path_as_is` enabled when opening Git repositories and only disable it for diff-based scans.
 - Created Linux and Windows specific installer script
 - Updated diff-focused scanning so `--branch-root-commit` can be provided alongside `--branch`, letting you diff from a chosen commit while targeting a specific branch tip (still defaulting back to the `--branch` ref when the commit is omitted).
 - Updated rules
 
 ## [v1.60.0]
 - Removed the `--bitbucket-username`, `--bitbucket-token`, and `--bitbucket-oauth-token` flags in favour of `KF_BITBUCKET_*` environment variables when authenticating to Bitbucket.
 - Added provider-specific `kingfisher scan` subcommands (for example `kingfisher scan github …`) that translate into the legacy flags under the hood. The new layout keeps backwards compatibility while removing the wall of provider options from `kingfisher scan --help`.
 - Updated the README so every provider example (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure Repos, Gitea, Hugging Face, Slack, Jira, Confluence, S3, GCS, Docker) uses the new subcommand style.
 - Legacy provider flags (for example `--github-user`, `--gitlab-group`, `--bitbucket-workspace`, `--s3-bucket`) still work but now emit a deprecation warning to encourage migration to the new `kingfisher scan <provider>` flow.
 - Kept the direct `kingfisher scan /path/to/dir` flow for local filesystem / local git repo scans while adding a `--list-only` switch to each provider subcommand so repository enumeration no longer requires the standalone `github repos`, `gitlab repos`, etc. commands.
 - Removed the legacy top-level provider commands (`kingfisher github`, `kingfisher gitlab`, `kingfisher gitea`, `kingfisher bitbucket`, `kingfisher azure`, `kingfisher huggingface`) now that enumeration lives under `kingfisher scan <provider> --list-only`.
 
 ## [v1.59.0]
 - Fixed `kingfisher scan github …` (and other provider-specific subcommands) so they no longer demand placeholder path arguments before the CLI accepts the request.
 - Fixed `kingfisher scan` so that providing `--branch` without `--since-commit` now diffs the branch against the empty tree and scans every commit reachable from that branch.
 - Added rules for meraki, duffel, finnhub, frameio, freshbooks, gitter, infracost, launchdarkly, lob, maxmind, messagebird, nytimes, prefect, scalingo, sendinblue, sentry, shippo, twitch, typeform
 
 - ## [v1.58.0]
 - Added first-class Hugging Face scanning support, including CLI enumeration, token authentication, and integration with remote scans.
 - Condensed GitError formatting to report the exit status and the first informative lines from stdout/stderr, producing concise git clone failure logs.
 - Added support for scanning Google Cloud Storage buckets via `--gcs-bucket`, including optional prefixes and service-account authentication.
